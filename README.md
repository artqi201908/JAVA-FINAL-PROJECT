## 2. Introduction

This document serves as a comprehensive high-level overview of the Food Waste Reduction Platform (FWRP), an innovative solution designed to address the critical issue of food waste. By leveraging technology, FWRP aims to facilitate the efficient redistribution of surplus food, connecting retailers with excess inventory to consumers and charitable organizations in need. The platform encompasses a suite of functionalities including inventory management for retailers, a matching algorithm to ensure timely distribution of food items, and a user-friendly interface for all stakeholders. Our project is spearheaded by a team consisting of Phuong Nguyen, Danni Hu, Wenqi Tang, and Feng Qi, each bringing specialized expertise to the project. Together, we are committed to delivering a useful and efficient platform that not only mitigates food waste but also fosters community engagement and support.

## 5. Application Architecture

### 5.1 Overview of the System Architecture

The Food Waste Reduction Platform leverages a meticulously designed modular architecture, emphasizing the separation of concerns to bolster maintainability and scalability. This architecture is organized into distinct layers, each tasked with a specific facet of the applicationâ€™s functionality, ensuring a robust and efficient system. These layers are:

- **Web Layer**: Serves as the primary interface for user requests, handling all HTTP interactions.
- **Business Layer**: This is the heart of the application, where core business logic resides. It processes inputs from users, enforces business rules, executes calculations, and makes critical decisions.
- **Data Access Layer (DAL)**: Facilitates all interactions with the database or any other form of persistence storage. It encompasses operations such as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and manages database connections, abstracting the complexities of database operations from the rest of the application.
- **View Layer**: Responsible for data presentation. It generates dynamic content based on user permissions and displays corresponding information in an accessible format.

### 5.2 Main Components

The platform is composed of several essential components that collectively aim to minimize food waste through effective user interaction, data analysis, and dissemination:

- **User Management Module**: Manages user-centric operations such as registration, authentication, and profile upkeep. Ensures secure access and personal information management.
- **Inventory Tracking Module**: Enables tracking of food inventory for entities like restaurants and supermarkets, crucial for identifying and mitigating potential sources of food waste.
- **Waste Analytics Module**: Utilizes inventory tracking data to identify waste patterns and trends, providing actionable insights for waste reduction.
- **Donation Coordination Module**: Facilitates connections between food donors and recipients, streamlining food donation processes with effective matching and logistical support.
- **Reporting and Message Boards Module**: Provides users and administrators with message boards and reports on waste metrics and reduction strategy effectiveness, aiding informed decision-making.
- **Notification System**: Engages users with alerts and reminders about food waste reduction opportunities and updates through email, SMS, and in-app notifications
